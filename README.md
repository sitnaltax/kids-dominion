# Geminion

A Dominion variant aimed at kids from around 5-8 years old.

## Overview

Geminion is a Dominion variant aimed at kids from around 5-8 years old. The focus skills are adding/multiplying small numbers and strategy; I have kept complexity there but removed it from the rest of the game when possible. 

Geminion plays 2-4 players. Like ordinary Dominion, you can play it with more (if you create more cards) but I don't recommend it.

Players familiar with ordinary Dominion can quickly [review the differences](differences.md).

## Components

The PDF is available [here](geminion.pdf).

* 80-160 "gems" (small tokens), based on player count
* One 8-card "starter deck" (the first page of the PDF) per player; I print these on a different color to make setup easy
* "Supply cards" (18 Double coins, 9 each of Triple coins, Gem Mine, Gem Trove; 4 each of Wish, Helper, Cleaner; 9 Rainbow)

The PDF contains 2 "starter decks". Print out more copies of the first two pages to play with more players.

I make the decks by cutting out the cards with a rotary paper cutter (scissors work fine) and putting them into an opaque-backed card sleeve in front of an unwanted CCG card.

## Goal

The goal is to be the player with the most gems when the gem supply is exhausted. Gems are gained by playing Gem cards.

## Setup

Give each player a starting deck consisting of 7 Penny cards and 1 Gem Stash card. Put the Gem Stash on the bottom.

Lay out the other cards in the supply. There should be 2 Rainbow cards per player; set the rest aside. (If you accidentally put out too many, that's fine.)

Put gems into the supply: 40 times the number of players.

The youngest player goes first.

## Play

On your turn, take the following steps:

1. Draw 4 cards from your deck.
2. Play each card in your hand.
    * When you play a "Gem" card, take gems from the supply according to the number on the card.
    * When you play a special Supply card, follow its instructions.

3. Buy more cards.
    * You can buy cards with a total cost (the bottom left number) of the value of the "Coin" cards you play. You can buy any number of cards that you can afford, and you don't have to buy cards if you don't want to.
    * When you buy a card, put it in your play area, with the other cards you played this turn. It doesn't do anything on the turn you buy it.
    * You can't buy cards if their supply is exhausted.

4. Clean up.
    * If you played any cards with a Recycle symbol this turn that you haven't already returned, put them back now. (This doesn't affect Recycle cards that you just bought them, of course.)
    * Take all of the other cards in your play area--both those you played this turn and those you bought--and put them in your discard pile. You can put them there in any order.

If you need to draw cards and you don't have any more in your deck, just flip your discard pile over to make a new deck! You don't need to shuffle. 

If all the gems are gone from the supply, the game is over. Everybody counts their gems and the player with the most is the winner!

## Supply Cards

The term "recycle" means to put a card back in its supply pile.

**Rainbow:** When you play this, you get one gem, and draw and play one more card. It's also worth one coin, as if you had played a Penny.

**Wish:** When you play this, draw and play three more cards and gain 3 gems. Then recycle it back to its Supply pile.

**Helper:** This card is worth 4 coins when you play it. Keep it in your play area to remember that you have the coins to spend, but remember to recycle it when you clean up at the end of your turn.

**Cleaner:** When you play this, you can recycle any number of cards from your hand, and it recycles itself. You don't get any coins or gems from cards you recycle. Then the Cleaner itself is also recycled.

**Sparkle:** When you play this, draw and play another card and gain one gem. Then recycle it back to its Supply pile.

You, or another player, can "purchase" recycled Penny or Gem Stash cards on a future turn (but you usually won't want to).

### Playtesting/Design Notes

Other than Rainbow, it is not intended that the supply piles will run out during ordinary play. If this is happening to you, use additional cards of the kind needed, and please let me know so I can adjust the supply.

Recycling is used as an alternative to Dominion trashing to make cleanup easier.

The no-shuffle mechanism is to make playing quicker and easier for kids who don't have much practice shuffling. For a more random, less deterministic game, you can shuffle your discard pile when you turn it into your new deck.

I considered having the players take the same number of turns and having more in the supply than the cutoff. That would be more fair at the cost of considerable rules complexity.

The audience doesn't seem to particularly mind that the cards you purchase on the last pass through your deck don't help you. Adding cards that give you gems when you buy them would add complexity, so I'm not inclined to do that.

I considered limiting buys to 1/turn for simplicity, but I want to avoid the feel-bad moment of a $12 hand that wastes $5 of potential. If you have strong feelings about this, let me know.
