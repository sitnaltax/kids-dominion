# Differences between Geminion and Dominion

A quick reference of things that are different for experienced Dominion players.

Almost all of these changes are to increase the game's kid-friendliness; either to reduce complexity, reduce the need for dexterity (holding a big hand of cards, shuffling), or make the game feel better to play (you get to collect a gem on the second turn!)

* Hand size is 4, not 5. The initial deck is 8 (7 coppers, 1 Estate-analogue)
* You draw up at the beginning of your turn, not the end.
* Victory cards give VP by playing them, not just having them in your deck.
* The endgame condition is the VP in the supply running out, not piles.
* You play your entire hand every turn; there is no limit to playing cards; cards don't have types.
* No limit to buys.
* Cards are different (of course) and there are many fewer of them. There are no attacks or "interactive" cards. 
* You don't shuffle; you just flip your discard pile over to make a new deck.
